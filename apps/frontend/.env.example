# Frontend Environment Variables
#
# NOTE: This frontend reads contract addresses directly from the root .env file
# No need to create a separate .env file in apps/frontend/
#
# Contract addresses are automatically loaded from:
# - PERMIT2
# - WILL_FACTORY
# - CID_UPLOAD_VERIFIER
# - WILL_CREATION_VERIFIER
# - JSON_CID_VERIFIER
# - ANVIL_RPC_URL (or defaults to http://127.0.0.1:8545)
#
# Just make sure the root .env file has the correct deployed contract addresses.
